// core/freshness.js — Tier-1 data-freshness policy.
//
// Why this exists: a silently stale number is a trust failure for this product. The
// feed must DISCLOSE how old its data is and when to consider it stale, under one
// documented policy that the dashboard, the API, and any downstream consumer apply
// identically. Pure: a function of the snapshot's own as-of timestamp plus one
// documented constant — no external input, so it stays Tier-1 (no assumption).

// The snapshot schedule, as facts. The cron (.github/workflows/update.yml,
// `0 0,12,14,16,18,20,22 * * *`) runs every 2h from 12:00 to 22:00 UTC plus 00:00,
// daily including weekends; the overnight pause (00:00 → 12:00 UTC) is the largest
// *scheduled* gap. The staleness threshold is DERIVED from these facts — never a
// free-standing literal — so it cannot silently desync from the cadence again
// (audit P0-1: the previous 50h literal was sized for the retired daily cadence;
// at 2h cadence it meant ~25 missed runs of silence before the STALE flag fired).
// test/schedule-coupling.test.js re-derives these numbers from the workflow cron
// and fails loudly if the schedule and this struct drift apart.

  JITTER_MARGIN_H: 3, // Actions queue-delay allowance
});

// Threshold = largest scheduled gap + one fully-missed run + queue jitter = 17h.
// A normal overnight pause (~12h) never flags; missing the first post-pause run
// (~14h gap) still doesn't cry wolf; anything beyond that is a genuine pipeline
// failure and trips the flag.

/**
 * Freshness policy for a snapshot taken at `asOfISO`. Returns the as-of anchor, the

 * age is inherently a read-time quantity; baking it at build time would be a lie
 * that goes wrong the moment the file sits unchanged). Pass `nowISO` (the live
