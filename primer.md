## ⮕ DIRECTION (2026-06-19): Phase 2b (accounts + watchlists) — 2b.1 DONE (gate PASSED), 2b.2 NOT STARTED
- **Where:** branch `feature/phase2b-accounts` (commit `cf029c4`) — **NOT merged to main, NOT pushed.**
  Held for operator go-ahead before 2b.2.
- **Design (approved):** invite-only accounts. `organizations` + `profiles` (1:1 `auth.users`) +
  `org_membership` (M:N) + `allowed_emails` (operator allowlist) + **two** watchlist tables —
  `personal_watchlist` (private) and `org_watchlist` (shared, **any-member** curate with `added_by`) —
  plus a `security_invoker` union view `my_visible_watchlist` (= personal ∪ org). Watchlist FK →
  `markets.id` (the 2a table). Watchlist CRUD is **client-direct** via supabase-js (RLS is the guard);
  **`/api/market` stays public + `no-store` + untouched** (don't entangle the verified-data path w/ auth).
- **2b.1 SHIPPED (schema + RLS + blocking gate):** `supabase/migrations/0002_phase2b.sql` (+ `_down`;
  additive, touches no 2a table). RLS on every new table; `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers `is_org_member`/
  `shares_org` avoid policy recursion; membership/allowlist are client-deny (operator/trigger only).
  **GATE PASSED through real JWTs** (`scripts/verify-phase2b-isolation.mjs`, dev project, run mqlazwzi):
  cross-tenant read/insert/delete all denied (42501; no phantom row; targets survive), union view
  scoped, B-symmetry, A curates own org. **This gate is the 2b RLS regression proof — re-run it after
  ANY 2b.2 auth change; auth must not loosen it.** Migration applied to the **dev** project only.
- **2b.2 NEXT (auth wiring + allowlist signup gate) — two LOCKED requirements from review:**
  1. **Verify the CURRENT Supabase signup-gate mechanism against live docs BEFORE writing it** — it's
     the least-proven piece (Auth Hooks vs a `before insert on auth.users` trigger; the API changed).
  2. **The 2b.2 test must prove the NEGATIVE:** a non-allowlisted email is **rejected AND no
     `auth.users` row is created**. Invite-only *failing open* is the 2b.2 P0 (peer of the 2b.1 leak).
  Then `handle_new_user` (SECURITY DEFINER) auto-provisions profile + membership from `allowed_emails`.
- **Deferred (do NOT scaffold):** dashboard UI (2c), notifications/email (2d), news, "market relates to
  other aspects" analysis (pending a concrete fund definition).

## ⮕ DIRECTION (2026-06-18): multi-market hosted product — Phase 2a DONE & LIVE-VERIFIED
- **Phase 2a (backend foundation) — SHIPPED on Vercel + Supabase.** A Vercel serverless function
  (`api/market.mjs`) serves ONE verified market on demand, backed by a Supabase cache. The verified
  pipeline runs on the backend (`lib/compute.mjs` → `core/`); the client never fetches Polymarket /
  bypasses `core/`; the cache only ever stores a `core/`-validated record (`lib/cache.mjs` `writeRecord`
  is the sole write path) and stores the frozen hash, never recomputes it. Cache×resolution precedence
  in `lib/decide-cache-action.mjs` (RESOLVED served forever; within-TTL OPEN is gamma-probed before
  serving so a since-resolved market is never served stale; TTL=15min). Auth/watchlists/notifications/
  news = **deferred** (2b/2c); schema is FK-ready. Also shipped: **R1** (CI failure → GitHub issue) +
  **R2** (fail-loud if a builder gets no MarketConfig).
- **LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-06-18: `scripts/verify-phase2a.mjs` 12/12 green against the deployed stack** —
  C1 OPEN market returns a re-hash-verified record; C2 repeat call is a TRUE Supabase cache hit
  (`cached:true`, function runs + reads cache, no Polymarket re-fetch); C3 SpaceX served frozen RESOLVED
  from the seed; C4 cache×resolution trap holds (a since-resolved market is never served stale-live).
  Supabase schema applied (`markets` + `market_snapshots`, RLS locked, `market_latest` view
  `security_invoker=on`); SpaceX seeded via `scripts/seed-spacex.mjs`.
- **⚠ LOAD-BEARING: `/api/market` sets `Cache-Control: no-store` — DO NOT add HTTP/edge caching.** The
  per-call resolution probe is the correctness layer; an edge-cached response (`x-vercel-cache: HIT`)
  skips the function and could replay a since-resolved market as OPEN (the C4 gap). Supabase is the cost
  layer. See [[gotchas]] "Vercel edge-caches …" and [[decisions]] "/api/market is never HTTP-cached".
- **Proven locally: 119 tests** (decision logic + orchestration incl. the cached-then-resolved trap);
  parity gate still green (SpaceX byte-identical).
- **Next: Phase 2b** — Supabase Auth + watchlists (FK-ready schema; no table rewrite needed).
  Plan fresh next session. Backlog to fold in:
  - [ ] **Deployment-protection posture** — Vercel deployment protection is currently **OFF** (was
    turned off for 2a live testing). Production access should be gated by **our own Supabase auth**
    (2b), **not Vercel's wall** — decide/lock this when 2b auth lands, and don't leave the preview
    open indefinitely. (Resolution correctness is already enforced server-side; this is access control.)
  - [ ] **Document the 0.5% `MATERIAL_ADJUSTMENT` threshold** (`core/confidence.js`) in
    `core/methodology.json` — an isotonic tweak below 0.5% is treated as immaterial and keeps the
    confidence tier high; that rule should be written into the methodology, not only the code.

## ⮕ DIRECTION (2026-06-17): multi-market hosted product — Phase 1 SHIPPED
- **Pivot:** generalizing from the single SpaceX market into a **hosted multi-market** product on
  **Vercel + Supabase** (Polymarket unchanged). Design: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (read before rebuild
  work). Governing principle: the verified pipeline runs on the backend, on demand + cached. See
  [[decisions]] "PIVOT".
- **Phase 1 DONE (core/ generalization + resolution guard, no infra):** `core/` now processes ANY
  threshold-ladder event via a per-market **MarketConfig** (`core/markets/*.json` + `core/market-config.js`
  `defaultConfigForLadder`) — no `if spacex` anywhere. SpaceX is one pinned instance whose output is
  **byte-identical** to pre-generalization (blocking gate `test/phase1-spacex-parity.test.js`: frozen
  `raw_sha256` `c1be52e4…b89003` + full derived deep-equal + 183-day history). Proven on a 2nd real
  ladder (Kraken IPO $16–28B) via the generic defaults. Two-stage lifecycle (`core/lifecycle.js` +
  `snapshot.lifecycle`: OPEN / CLOSED_PENDING / RESOLVED) classified from gamma meta; Tier-2 scenarios
  optional. methodology **1.4.0**, schema **1.3.0**. 99/99 tests.
- **⚠ SpaceX RESOLVED (2026-06-17):** the market settled — realized cap in **$2.0–2.2T** (>$2T Yes,
  >$2.2T No), matching the last live median ~$2.1T. The feed is **frozen** (lifecycle RESOLVED,
  `freshness.final`, no live pull; re-runs skip). This also fixed a live breakage: the OLD v1 cron was
  crashing every run with "No midpoint" because a resolved market returns no CLOB midpoints (see [[gotchas]]).
- **Next:** Phase 2 (serverless compute + Supabase cache) per ARCHITECTURE §9. The v1 GitHub-Actions/
  Pages app below now serves the frozen resolved SpaceX record.

## Current state
- **Live:** https://ilanbenamaro-cyber.github.io/polymarket-tracker/
- Methodology **1.3.0**, schema **1.2.1**, assumptions **1.0.0** — all three embedded in every snapshot.
  (1.3.0 = 2h cadence + schedule-derived 17h staleness threshold + post-publish verify gate;
  policy change, NO formula change. 1.2.1 = source-of-record + verifier + freshness.)
- **Cadence (2026-06-12):** snapshots every 2h, 12:00–00:00 UTC (overnight pause 00→12 UTC = max
  12h gap → threshold 12+2+3 = **17h**, derived in `core/freshness.js` SCHEDULE; coupling test binds
  it to the update.yml cron). Dashboard auto-refreshes (10 min + visibilitychange, silent failures).
- Branch `feature/cadence-audit` carries the 2026-06-12 audit pass (8-seam directed audit:
  4 P1 fixes each with regression tests + cadence migration + verify gate). Repo: `ilanbenamaro-cyber/polymarket-tracker`.

## What this is (3 sentences)
An institutional prediction-market data product: it turns Polymarket's "SpaceX IPO closing
market cap above $X?" markets into a trustworthy valuation signal. It serves a canonical JSON
API (`docs/api/v1/`), a dashboard, and a printable research note, all projecting from one
core record. **Public Polymarket data only** — no grey-market/secondary data (that's v2, out of scope).

## How to run
- `node scripts/snapshot.js` — main entry (the cron runs this): fetch → build canonical record
  (isotonic-adjusted, analytics, scenarios, narrative) → validate (schema+invariants+firewall) →
  write API → append today to history → bake HTML fallback.
- `node scripts/backfill.js` — one-time/idempotent: rebuild full history from Polymarket price-history.
- `node scripts/verify-accuracy.js` — independent accuracy harness: dual-source fetch (Gamma + CLOB) ×2,
  cross-source + drift + published-vs-live reconciliation; report-only. Canonical green path: run
  snapshot then verify while seconds-old → PASS (exit 0). Flags: `--strict --json --price-window-hours --staleness-hours`.
- `node --test` — unit tests (currently **80/80**: PAVA, band, anomalies, hash, firewall (incl.
  numeric-0 leaves), rounding, analytics, freshness + schedule coupling, accuracy-verifier zones,
  dashboard contract (velDelta/auto-refresh), email digest inputs, full-history invariant sweep).
- Output lands in **`docs/api/v1/`** (`latest.json`, `history.json` lean, `history-full.json`,
  `history.csv`, `methodology.json`, `schema.json`, `snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD.json`).
- Local preview: `cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8000` (the page `fetch`es the API, so use HTTP not file://).

## VERIFIED
- Local pipeline: snapshot + backfill run clean; 176-day history; 0 negative buckets across all days.
- Dashboard + 3-page note render with **0 console errors** (favicon present); verify-hash MATCH/MISMATCH works.
- Firewall enforced: validate.js throws on a stripped/unsourced scenario assumption and on a Tier-1 leak.
- Live API serves 1.2.1 with CORS `*`; schema validates (incl. additive `derived.freshness`).
- **Accuracy verifier** run live: canonical path (snapshot→verify seconds-old) = PASS; price-match FAIL
  and aged-drift OK paths both confirmed; cross-source (Gamma vs CLOB) agrees live; source curve valid.
- **Freshness** verified via Playwright: fresh state shows "as-of age" muted + badge hidden; stale state
  shows red age + STALE pill; 0 console errors.
- node --test 43/43.
- **CI pipeline proven END-TO-END** ✅ — `workflow_dispatch` (mode snapshot) ran green
  (run 27154304762): npm ci on ubuntu, snapshot, schema validation, and the bot commit/push all
  succeeded. The new **concurrency-safe push** path worked (snapshot commit `01d505b` landed on
  `origin/main` via fetch→rebase→push). Was UNVERIFIED #1 — now done.

## UNVERIFIED (do these — top item FIRST)
1. **First overnight pause under the 2h cadence** — after merge, confirm the 12:00 UTC run lands and
   the dashboard never showed STALE overnight (the 12h-gap-not-stale policy, validated in production).
2. Email/push path (`send-emails.js`) is dormant and unrun in CI (intended; guarded to skip without
   secrets). Now reads `docs/api/v1/` — the deleted-data.json time bomb is fixed but the live send
   path is still unexercised.

## Recently shipped (2026-06-12 audit pass, branch feature/cadence-audit)
- [x] **8-seam directed audit** — severity-ranked ledger; 4 P1s fixed each with a regression test:
  firewall numeric-0 leaf bypass (validate.js null-checks), impliedSharePrice Infinity on zero range
  bound, velDelta D1 re-derivation (3rd occurrence — now renders stored display), send-emails read
  the deleted docs/data.json (now reads v1 API, ascending-history prior). See [[decisions]], ledger
  in the session report.
- [x] **2h cadence + schedule-derived 17h staleness threshold** (was 50h literal) + coupling test +
  methodology **1.3.0**. See [[decisions]].
- [x] **CI verify gate, publish-then-alert** (non-strict, last step, transport-aware retry) — closes
  the old "wire --strict gate" task with deliberately different semantics. See [[decisions]].
- [x] **Dashboard auto-refresh** (10 min + visibilitychange; silent failures keep the view) +
  **mobile table scroll** (375px verified, was overflowing).
- [x] **Full-history invariant sweep test** (181 days through production validators) + CSV constraint.

## Immediate open tasks
- [ ] **Document the 0.5% confidence threshold** (`MATERIAL_ADJUSTMENT` in `core/confidence.js`) in
  `core/methodology.json` — an isotonic tweak below 0.5% is treated as immaterial and keeps tier high;
  that rule should be written down in the methodology, not just the code.
- [ ] **P2 backlog from the audit** (documented, deliberately deferred): scenarios.js pct Math.round
  asymmetric on negatives vs roundT (changing alters published Tier-2 values — needs its own
  methodology note); inline money() can render $-0.00T (unreachable today); quantileValuation
  CDF-touches-0.50-at-last-node returns null (definitional).
