// lib/decide-cache-action.mjs — the cache read-path decision, as PURE functions.
//
// Why this exists: the cache×resolution interaction is the correctness trap of
// Phase 2 (ARCHITECTURE §3.1) — a market that resolves after being cached must
// NEVER be served as stale "live" data. The decision logic is isolated here, with
// no I/O, so every branch is unit-tested deterministically; the serverless handler
// does the actual fetches/DB writes around it.
//
// Precedence (highest first):
//   1. RESOLVED is authoritative & monotonic → serve the frozen final record
//      forever, no probe, no Polymarket call.
//   2. A cached OPEN/CLOSED_PENDING record past CACHE_TTL → RECOMPUTE (the
//      recompute re-classifies lifecycle from gamma meta, so resolution is caught).
//   3. A cached OPEN/CLOSED_PENDING record within CACHE_TTL → confirm it has not
//      resolved before serving: PROBE (cheap gamma meta) unless a probe ran within
//      PROBE_TTL, in which case trust it and SERVE_FRESH.
//   4. No cached row → COMPUTE (miss).

export const CACHE_TTL_MS = 15 * 60 * 1000; // OPEN-market freshness window
export const CACHE_TTL_HOURS = CACHE_TTL_MS / 3_600_000; // for buildSnapshotRecord freshness
